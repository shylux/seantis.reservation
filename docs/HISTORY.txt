Changelog
=========

1.2.1 (unreleased)
------------------

- Move reservation specific styles from plonetheme.onegov to this package.
  [lknoepfel]

1.2.0 (2015-02-10)
------------------

*Warning*: The seantis.reservation release 1.2.0 changed a lot internally,
which is why you can't directly upgrade from seantis.reservation releases
prior to 1.0.12 (September 27th, 2013) to the 1.2.0.

If you do have such an old release, install seantis.reservation 1.1.5 first,
run all upgrade steps, and then install 1.2.0.

- Moves the core to a new, plone-independent Python Module (Libres).

1.1 (2014-08-05)
----------------

- Adds new search & reserve feature. On each resource, users may search
  for allocations. Those allocations may be selected and reserved in compound.

  This is a big new feature and 1.1 is meant to be the canary for it. There
  are certain things which don't yet work: group reservations are kept out
  of the search, the compound reservations don't show up everywhere yet and
  there are rough edges in the UI.

  If you are not absolutely sure you need this release we therefore recommend
  to wait for a week or two. We'll deliver 1.1.+ which will be a more stable
  and more widely adapted release.
  [href]

- Hide the timeframes selection in the allocation and search form, inside
  an icon close to the dates.

  some things. Fixes #159.

-------------------

- Adds the ability to define green/orange/red thresholds in the controlpanel.
  Fixes #158.
  [href]

  happen if the custom forms are changed after the data has been written.
  Fixes #150.
  [href]

- Limits the width of the day view, to improve the accessibility of the menu.
  Fixes #157.
  [href]

  [href]

- Adds thank-you page shown after submitting a reservation. Each resource
  may have a custom text which is shown under the thank you note. Closes #138.
  [href]

- Refetch less agressively to make the interface 'calmer'. Only actions by

  cancel button of an overlay for example won't reload the events anymore.
  [href]

  Fixes #142.

  Fixes #116.
  [href]

  for users, but it ensures better data integrity in the future. Fixes #119.
  [href]

- Integrates seantis.plonetools.
  [href]

- Make sure that the exposure checking method doesn't trip up if the resource

  [deiferni]

1.0.16
------

- Fixes throttling being triggered on invalid reservations. Throttling should
  only be active if the reservation is actually made.

1.0.15
------

- Adds the ability to define pre-reservation script which may trigger
  validation errors on the reservation form.

1.0.14
------

- Adds the ability to print single reservations.

- Adds the ability to remove a reservation without sending an email.

1.0.13
------

- Adds a new 'latest reservations' report, showing reservations done in the last
  30 days.

1.0.12
------

- Removing expired sessions no longer results in orphan reserved slots. Existing
  orphan reserved slots are removed by the upgrade step.

- Exceptions in the 'your-reservations' form are now handled correctly,
  resulting in properly displayed errors.

1.0.11
------

- The date and start-/end-time are now properly disabled on the form if they
  may not be edited.

- Fixes 'continue' button not working on group forms

- Fixes radio-buttons and check-boxes not showing up on group forms

1.0.10
------

1.0.9
-----

- Fixes being unable to confirm 'your-reservations' outside the resource.

1.0.8
-----

- Adds a new view for exports which initially offers the existing reservations
  export and a new 'compact' export.

  when trying to do multiple reservations.

- Fixes typo in English text.

- Improves German texts.

1.0.7
-----

- Removes potentially dangerous orphan removal from settings panel.

- All reservation records stored in Postgres belonging to a certain resource
  are now wiped if said resource is deleted.

  The exception is the removal of a plone site through the ZMI. Though it is
  possible to intercept that event it is not entirely save to discard all
  resources that are part of plone site being deleted. It is namely possible
  that those have the same uuid as another existing resource of another site.

  To clean these kind of data zombies it might be good to create a tool with
  which reservations before a given date are wiped or archived.

  This is however not a priority as it is recommended to have a separate
  database for each site anyway and until there's a high volume reservations
  site in existance this won't ever be a problem. Postgres can handle unused
  records.

- Stops allocation.mirror_of from potentially being NULL.

- Fixes a bug where reservations could be added to waitinglists on allocations
  that were not meant to have a waitinglist.

- Fixes typo in German translation

1.0.6
-----

- Adds the ability to edit the formdata of a reservation through the management
  or the report interface

- Adds the ability to define Manager Formsests which are the same as Default
  Formsets but can only be edited by someone with the appropriate permission.

  With these formsets and the ability to edit the formdata it's possible to
  create simple ways to organize reservations. A manager formset could be added
  with a checkbox "paid" for example, along a normal formset with the address.

  Each reservation will then have an address filled by the user and a "paid"-checkbox.
  The reservee cannot see or change this checkbox, but the manager can do so
  once the reservee has actually paid whatever he was supposed to.

  The initial values of those manager-only fields are defined throught the
  Dexterity-Schema editor.

- No longer compresses URI.js, fixing javascript errors in the browser
- Fixes missing translations in certain cases (locale.js is now more robust)
- Uses ajax on the monthly report to load reservation changes

1.0.5
-----

- Adds whole-day flag to reservations export
- Adds quota to reservations export
- Adds the ability to show/hide the timetable in the monthly report
- Keep filter state between months in monthly report
